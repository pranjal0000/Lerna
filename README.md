Automated tuning of EC tools

The workflow is simplified as follows:
1) The uncorrected reads are converted to torch tensors on which the Language model is trained
2) The reads are corrected (for multiple 'k' values) using a standard Error correcting tool, for example, LorDEC
3) The corrected reads are converted to tensors on which the Language model evaluation is done
4) Simulated annealing is run on the perplexity values generated by evaluation where the 'k' value corresponding to minimum perplexity is chosen
